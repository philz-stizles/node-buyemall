// REST API PRINCIPLES
-   Uniform Interface - Clearly defined API endpoints with clearly defined requests + response data structure
-   Stateless - Server and Client dont share any connection history, every request is handled separately.
-   Cacheable - Servers may set caching headers to allow client to cache responses
-   Code on demand - Executable code may be transferred from server to client


Graphql
    using graphql & express-graphql


    Authentication & Authorization

// TESTING
